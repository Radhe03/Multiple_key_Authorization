# Multiple_key_Authorization

Multiple Key Authorization (MKA) is an authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more verification keys(shares) to gain access to a resource such as an application, online account, or a VPN. MKA is a core component of a strong identity and access management (IAM) policy. Rather than just asking for a username and password, MKA requires one or more additional verification factors, which decreases the likelihood of a successful cyber attack.![image](https://github.com/Radhe03/Multiple_key_Authorization/assets/121745528/631d7bbc-aa35-4203-b73a-2716fcb7c4cf)
